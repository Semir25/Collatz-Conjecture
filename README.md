# Collatz-Conjecture
The Collatz conjecture in mathematics asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform every positive integer into one.

It is a simple sequence:
* if the number is even divide it by two
* if the number is odd multiply it by three and add 1

Compile with g++ main.cpp collatz.cpp -o collatz-conjecture
